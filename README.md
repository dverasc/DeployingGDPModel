# DeployingGDPModel

This repo contains three files used to deploy a linear regression model using a web connection.
I used Flask for the web aspect and various ML libraries to create the model.

The model uses the life expectancy to calculate the GDP per capita using various nation's historical demographic statistics.
The test dependent variable in this case is 75 aka we are seeing what the GDP per capita should be if the life expectancy is 75.
